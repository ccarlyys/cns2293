I have used git quite a bit. 
My first experience with it was on my high school's robotics team. 
We used git because our team was rather large and we had to keep the code somewhere that it could be accessed by everyone. 
I never really liked it in that setting, because I kept losing track of what all the commands were. 
More recently, I have been working with a team of other students at Texas Inventionworks, the engineering makerspace, to build a web app that manages reservations, tool inventory, etc. It was my first big coding project besided robotics, and it took me a couple of tries to fully grasp the flow and commands of git. I mostly used the built-in git functions in the VSCode IDE, which made things easier for me. 
After I got the hand of it, I found it very useful. It is nice knowing that if I, or anyone else, messes something up, I am not ruining someone else's work.
